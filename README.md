# American University Athletics rosters

A [Python program](mbb-scrape.py) to scrape data tables from [AU Athletics' website](https://aueagles.com/) containing the rosters for its various NCAA Division I teams. Aimed at streamlining data collection for sports journalists.

It formats the data into a CSV for a single team in which each line is one player. The client can choose which team. The code also fixes abbreviations and height formatting, and it separates the hometown, state/country, and high school into their own columns.

Teams:\
Mens Basketball ([CSV](aueagles-mbb-roster.csv))\
Women's Basketball ([CSV](aueagles-wbb-roster.csv))
